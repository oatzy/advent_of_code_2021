# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for advent of code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Feeling lazy this year, so will probably just do it in python.

## Update (2021-12-25)

50/50 stars (!)

This is the first year (out of 4) that I've managed to solve all the puzzles without help.

Truth be told, there were several times in the last few days when I considered giving up. But for whatever reason, I just couldn't let it go and somehow managed to solve them.

This year it felt like more of the (later) puzzles were a case of -- the 'simple' solution from part 1 isn't fast enough to solve part 2. Maybe it just felt that way because I was using python instead of rust (?) In any case, a lot of my solutions took longer than the alleged '15s at most'. That may be python, or it may just be a reflection of my abilities :grimace:

One other interesting thing is that I didn't need any external dependencies; tho I did have to implement my own Dijkstra (for better or worse).

As with last year, I've included a pdf of my notes for posterity/interest. In particular, day 24 was solved on (e)paper rather than in code.

Every year I struggle and suffer through the last few days of puzzles, and tell myself I won't bother next year. And then I get sucked in again by the easier puzzles. So.. we'll see.
